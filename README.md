# PharmacyApp

A matching game built using Unity that utilizes VR in order to quiz Pharmacy students on the top 200 drugs they need to know. The game will
ask whether they want to match brand to generic or vice versa. It will then have 5 different selections to choose from, 4 of which are picked 
randomly from the list of drug names. There are a few options, one simply being 5 different drug names for testing and the grueling 200 for 
those who want a challenge.
